# Coding-Quiz
User Story
AS A coding boot camp student
I WANT to take a timed quiz on JavaScript fundamentals that stores high scores
SO THAT I can gauge my progress compared to my peers
Acceptance Criteria
GIVEN I am taking a code quiz
WHEN I click the start button
THEN a timer starts and I am presented with a question
WHEN I answer a question
THEN I am presented with another question
WHEN I answer a question incorrectly
THEN time is subtracted from the clock
WHEN all questions are answered or the timer reaches 0
THEN the game is over
WHEN the game is over
THEN I can save my initials and score

# How It's Going

so far, I have added most of the functionality save for a couple of things. 
Here is what I can improve: 

a) I can add the button functionality so that when high scores are clicked in the main menu, you can see the high scores screen but ONLY if the game has not begun

b) I can add the other three questions as displayed in the class example

c) I can add styles to the questions and possible answers once the quiz begins to keep it as in the example (I can make the possible answers more spaced out, and add a line at the bottom)

d) I can shift the 'begin quiz' button to be more centered

e) Timer starts at 0 and as SOON as the button is pressed, the timer switches to 75 and starts counting down with no delays

Once these things are added, it should be smooth sailing from there.
