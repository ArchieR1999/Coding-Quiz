# Coding-Quiz
This Quiz is a pretty cool. It asks 5 questions to the user once the 'start' button is pressed. There is consistent styling although the button could be centered at the beginning. Once an answer is correct or incorrectly answered, the user will receive feedback and points will be either not taken away if the answer is correct or a ten-second penalty to the user for a wrong answer. Once the game is over, the scores are kept in localStorage and are added to a 'scoreboard'. Another issue is that the game does not allow the user to access the highscores board in the start screen. To make this a better quiz game, it should be implemented only for games that have not yet begun. Otherwise, it works as intended. 

# How It's Going
so far, I have added most of the functionality save for a couple of things. 
Here is what I can improve: 
a) I can add the button functionality so that when high scores are clicked in the main menu, you can see the high scores screen but ONLY if the game has not begun
b) I can shift the 'begin quiz' button to be more centered
